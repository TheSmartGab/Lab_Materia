Further Measures were taken in order to characterize the response of the experimental setup to glass. 

Observations
1) The absorbance graph is but 1-T, T is the only value that the setup could possibly measure. 
2) Negative Values were observed for glass_glasse(T) in the NUV region where glass absorbs most of the incident Intensity. Could be due to problems with readout electronics when
   the signal is below the sensibility of the instrument

Possible explanation for air-air graph from last time:
The light is split in a different way by the monocrhomator in the two lines for the different wavelenghts. Note that both signals are analyzed with only one photomultiplier.

To do:
find what is exactely the monochromator in the machine
